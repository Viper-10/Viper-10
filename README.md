Hello, I'm Priyadharshan. I'm currently pursuing BE CSE in Kumaraguru College of Technology(Coimbatore). 

I'm a backend developer with good knowledge about spring, springboot, spring mvc. I'm willing to join projects which uses spring as the backend and believe I can be of use. 

I do competitive coding from time to time and I take pleasure in teaching coding to others. 
I've been organising contents for Department Association of CSE for the academic year 2020-2021 and I manage the github repositories of DA-CSE as well. 

You can contact me through my email priyadharshanbeepee@gmail.com. 

Viper-10 is my alias for almost all of my accounts.
